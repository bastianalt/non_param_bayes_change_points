# Introduction
This is the companion code to the paper 'Non-Parametric Bayesian Inference for Change Point Detection in Neural Spike Trains' [B. Alt, M. Messer, J. Roeper, G. Schneider and H. Koeppl].

Simulations similar to the ones used in the paper can be run with this matlab code.

# Simulation
Example simulation can be found in the file In_Silico_Example.m
